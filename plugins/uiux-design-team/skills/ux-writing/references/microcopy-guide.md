## Button Labels

Buttons are the most important text on any screen. They tell users what will happen when they interact.

### Primary Action Buttons

| Context | Bad | Good | Why |
|---------|-----|------|-----|
| Creating an account | Submit | Create account | Specific verb describes the outcome |
| Saving changes | OK | Save changes | Confirms what "OK" actually does |
| Publishing content | Submit | Publish post | Names the action and the object |
| Sending a message | Send | Send message | Adds the object for clarity |
| Starting a trial | Continue | Start free trial | Names the value proposition |
| Uploading a file | Upload | Upload image | Specifies what is being uploaded |
| Generating a report | Go | Generate report | Describes the process that will begin |

### Secondary and Cancel Buttons

| Context | Bad | Good | Why |
|---------|-----|------|-----|
| Canceling form changes | Cancel | Discard changes | Clarifies what canceling does |
| Closing without saving | No | Don't save | States the consequence explicitly |
| Dismissing a notification | X | Dismiss | Accessible label for screen readers |
| Going back in a flow | Back | Back to settings | Names the destination |
| Skipping an optional step | Skip | Skip for now | Implies they can return later |

### Destructive Action Buttons

| Context | Bad | Good | Why |
|---------|-----|------|-----|
| Deleting a project | Yes | Delete project | Names the destructive action explicitly |
| Removing a team member | Remove | Remove Sarah from team | Names the person and the consequence |
| Canceling a subscription | Confirm | Cancel subscription | No ambiguity about what is being confirmed |
| Clearing all data | Reset | Clear all data | Specific about what is being reset |

### Button Copy Rules

1. **Start with a verb.** "Save draft" not "Draft save." The action comes first.
2. **Name the object when ambiguous.** "Delete" is ambiguous. "Delete project" is not.
3. **Match the button to the page heading.** If the heading says "Create a new project," the button says "Create project."
4. **Keep it under 4 words.** Long button labels signal a design problem, not a copy problem.

## Form Text

Forms are where users provide information. Every text element in a form either helps or hinders completion.

### Form Labels

Labels should be concise, specific, and placed directly above or beside the input.

| Bad | Good | Why |
|-----|------|-----|
| Name | Full name | "Name" is ambiguous (first? last? display?) |
| Email | Email address | Slightly more specific; helps autofill |
| Phone | Phone number | Consistent with "Email address" pattern |
| Address | Street address | Distinguishes from email or IP address |
| Password | Create a password | Distinguishes from "enter your existing password" |

### Placeholder Text

Placeholders show format examples, not instructions. They disappear on input, so they must not contain essential information.

| Bad | Good | Why |
|-----|------|-----|
| Enter your email | jane@example.com | Shows format instead of restating the label |
| Type here | Search projects... | Describes what happens in context |
| Enter date | MM/DD/YYYY | Shows the expected format |
| Enter your name | (leave empty) | The label is sufficient; placeholder adds noise |

**Rule:** Never use placeholder text as a replacement for labels. Placeholders disappear when the user starts typing, removing the context they need.

### Help Text

Help text appears below the input and provides guidance that does not fit in the label.

| Context | Bad Help Text | Good Help Text |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Password field | Must be strong | At least 8 characters with one number and one symbol |
| Username field | Choose a username | Letters, numbers, and underscores only. This cannot be changed later. |
| Bio field | Tell us about yourself | 160 characters max. Appears on your public profile. |
| URL field | Enter URL | Include https:// (e.g., https://example.com) |

### Inline Validation Messages

Validation messages appear when input does not meet requirements. They must be specific, not generic.

| Bad | Good | Why |
|-----|------|-----|
| Invalid input | Enter a valid email address (e.g., name@example.com) | Names the problem and shows the expected format |
| Required field | Add a project name to continue | Names the specific field and the consequence |
| Too short | Use at least 8 characters (you have 5) | States the requirement and the current state |
| Invalid format | Phone numbers should include 10 digits | States the expected format |
| Already exists | That username is taken. Try adding numbers or underscores. | Explains why and suggests a fix |

### Required vs. Optional Fields

- Mark optional fields, not required ones. Most fields are required; marking the minority reduces visual noise.
- Use the word "(optional)" next to the label, not an asterisk.
- Never use color alone to indicate required status.

## Tooltips and Help

### Tooltip Content

Tooltips provide additional context for elements that are otherwise clear enough to not need a label. They appear on hover or focus.

| Element | Bad Tooltip | Good Tooltip | Why |
|---------|------------|--------------|-----|
| Lock icon on a post | Info | Visible to team members only | Provides the actual information |
| Settings gear icon | Settings | Account settings | More specific than the generic label |
| Keyboard shortcut | Shortcut | Bold (Cmd+B) | Names the action and the shortcut |
| Disabled button | Disabled | Complete all required fields to continue | Explains why and how to enable |
| User avatar | User | Sarah Chen (Admin) | Shows the person's name and role |

### Tooltip Rules

1. **Never put essential information in a tooltip.** If the user must know it to complete a task, it belongs in the visible UI.
2. **Keep tooltips under 15 words.** Tooltips that require reading are failing at their job.
3. **Do not duplicate visible labels.** A tooltip that says "Settings" on a button labeled "Settings" adds nothing.
4. **Include keyboard shortcuts.** Tooltips on toolbar items should show the keyboard shortcut.

### Contextual Help Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Inline help text | Always-visible guidance below a form field | "We'll send a confirmation to this address." |
| Tooltip | Supplementary info on hover/focus | "Last synced 5 minutes ago" |
| Help icon (?) | Complex concepts that need explanation | Clicking reveals: "API keys authenticate your requests. Keep them secret." |
| Expandable section | Detailed guidance for optional reading | "Learn more about webhooks" expands a paragraph |
| Guided tour | First-time feature introduction | Step-by-step overlay highlighting key UI elements |

## Navigation and Page Titles

### Navigation Labels

Navigation labels must be scannable, predictable, and hierarchical.

| Bad | Good | Why |
|-----|------|-----|
| Hub | Dashboard | "Hub" is vague; "Dashboard" is a recognized pattern |
| Stuff | Resources | Generic labels slow scanning |
| My Things | My Projects | Name the specific content type |
| Manage | Team Members | "Manage" requires a click to understand what is managed |
| More | Settings | "More" hides the content; name it if space allows |

### Breadcrumb Labels

Breadcrumbs show hierarchical location. Each segment should be clickable and use the same label as the page it links to.

```
Home > Projects > Website Redesign > Tasks
```

- Use the actual page title for each breadcrumb segment
- Separate with ">" or "/" consistently
- Truncate middle segments on mobile: "Home > ... > Tasks"
- The current page (last segment) is not a link

### Page Titles

Page titles appear in the browser tab and the page heading. They should be descriptive and unique.

| Bad | Good | Why |
|-----|------|-----|
| Page 1 | Create New Project | Describes the page's purpose |
| Dashboard | Project Dashboard | Adds context about which dashboard |
| Settings | Account Settings | Specifies which settings |
| Untitled | Invoice #2847 | Uses the specific object name |

**Browser tab pattern:** `Page Name - Section - Product Name`
Example: `Account Settings - Settings - Acme App`

## Confirmation Dialogs

Confirmation dialogs interrupt the user to verify a decision. They must be clear about what will happen and what will not happen.

### Destructive Action Confirmations

```
Title: Delete "Website Redesign"?

Body: This will permanently delete the project and all 47 tasks,
12 files, and 3 milestones inside it. This action cannot be undone.

Primary button: Delete project (destructive style)
Secondary button: Keep project
```

**Rules for destructive confirmations:**
1. **Name the object being destroyed** in the title ("Website Redesign," not just "this project").
2. **State the consequences** including what else will be affected (tasks, files, data).
3. **State irreversibility** clearly: "This action cannot be undone" or "You can restore this from trash for 30 days."
4. **Use a destructive-styled primary button** (red) with specific label ("Delete project," not "Yes").
5. **Use a safe secondary button** with a positive label ("Keep project," not "Cancel").

### State Change Confirmations

```
Title: Publish "Q4 Report"?

Body: This will make the report visible to all team members.
You can unpublish it later from the report settings.

Primary button: Publish report
Secondary button: Keep as draft
```

### Unsaved Changes Confirmation

```
Title: You have unsaved changes

Body: Do you want to save your changes before leaving?

Primary button: Save changes
Secondary button: Discard changes
Tertiary button: Cancel (return to editing)
```

**Three-button pattern:** When there are three distinct outcomes (save, discard, cancel), provide three buttons. Do not force a binary choice when three options exist.

### Permission Requests

```
Title: Allow notifications?

Body: We'll send you updates when someone comments on your
work or assigns you a task. You can change this in Settings.

Primary button: Allow notifications
Secondary button: Not now
```

**Rules for permission requests:**
- Explain the benefit, not just the request
- Tell users where to change the setting later
- Use "Not now" instead of "No" to reduce dismissal friction

## Success and Status Messages

### Success Messages (Toasts)

| Context | Bad | Good | Why |
|---------|-----|------|-----|
| Saving a document | Success! | Changes saved | Names what was saved |
| Sending an email | Done | Email sent to sarah@example.com | Confirms the recipient |
| Creating a project | Project created | "Website Redesign" created | Names the specific object |
| Uploading a file | Upload complete | 3 files uploaded to /assets | Counts items and names the location |
| Password change | Updated | Password updated | Names what was updated |

### Progress Messages

| Stage | Message | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Starting | Generating your report... | Sets expectation about what is happening |
| In progress | Processing 847 of 2,340 records... | Shows progress with numbers |
| Almost done | Finalizing... | Signals the end is near |
| Complete | Report generated. 2,340 records processed. | Confirms completion with summary |

### Loading Messages

| Bad | Good | Why |
|-----|------|-----|
| Loading... | Preparing your dashboard... | Describes what is loading |
| Please wait | Connecting to server... | Explains why there is a wait |
| Loading... | Searching 10,000+ projects... | Provides context for the delay |

## Empty States and Onboarding

### First-Use Empty States

First-use empty states appear when the user has not yet added content.

**Structure:**
1. **Visual** (illustration or icon) -- Represents what this space is for
2. **Headline** -- Names the feature: "No projects yet"
3. **Description** -- Explains the value: "Projects help you organize tasks, deadlines, and team members in one place."
4. **CTA** -- Provides the first action: "Create your first project"

| Context | Bad Headline | Good Headline | Good Description |
|---------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| Project list | No data | No projects yet | Create a project to organize your team's work in one place. |
| Notification center | Empty | All caught up | New notifications will appear here when someone mentions you or assigns you a task. |
| Search results | No results | No results for "flux capacitor" | Try different keywords or check your spelling. |
| Filtered list | Nothing here | No open tasks match these filters | Try adjusting your filters or clearing them to see all tasks. |

### Onboarding Text

Onboarding text guides new users through setup and first use.

**Step-by-step onboarding:**

| Step | Heading | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | What should we call you? | This appears on your profile and in notifications to your team. |
| 2 | Invite your team | Add team members by email. They'll get an invitation to join your workspace. |
| 3 | Create your first project | Give it a name and description. You can always change these later. |

**Onboarding rules:**
1. **Show value before asking for effort.** Let users explore before requiring account creation.
2. **One question per screen.** Do not combine name, email, and company on one screen.
3. **Reassure about reversibility.** "You can change this later" reduces decision anxiety.
4. **Use progressive profiling.** Ask for minimal information now; request more as the user engages.

### Inline Onboarding Tips

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Feature callout | "New: Try keyboard shortcuts. Press ? to see all shortcuts." |
| Empty state guidance | "Tip: Drag tasks between columns to update their status." |
| First-time tooltip | "This is your inbox. Messages from your team appear here." |
| Completion encouragement | "Great start! You've completed 2 of 5 setup steps." |

## Empty State Type Templates

**First-use empty state** (user has never added content):
- Visual that hints at the feature
- Headline naming the feature: "No projects yet"
- Description of value: "Projects help you organize tasks, deadlines, and team members in one place."
- Clear CTA: "Create your first project"

**User-cleared empty state** (user removed all content):
- Acknowledge: "All caught up!"
- Reinforce value: "New tasks will appear here when assigned to you."
- Optional CTA: "Browse open tasks"

**Error empty state** (content failed to load):
- State what failed: "Couldn't load your projects"
- Recovery action: "Try again" button
- Alternative path: "Check your connection or visit our status page"

## Common UI Text Patterns

| Element | Bad | Good | Why |
|---------|-----|------|-----|
| Submit button | Submit | Create account | Specific verb describes outcome |
| Cancel button | Cancel | Discard changes | Clarifies what canceling does |
| Delete confirmation | Are you sure? | Delete "Project Alpha"? This can't be undone. | Names the thing, states the consequence |
| Empty search | No results | No results for "fluxcapacitor". Try a different search term. | Reflects query, suggests next step |
| Loading state | Loading... | Preparing your dashboard... | Describes what is happening |
| Tooltip | Info | Visible to team members only | Provides actual information |
| Form placeholder | Enter text here | jane@example.com | Shows format, not instruction |
| Success toast | Success | Invoice sent to jane@example.com | Confirms specific action |

## Button & CTA Patterns

| Action | Weak | Strong |
|--------|------|--------|
| Creating | Submit | Create project |
| Saving | OK | Save changes |
| Deleting | Yes | Delete file |
| Upgrading | Continue | Start free trial |
| Inviting | Add | Send invitation |
| Confirming | OK | Got it |
| Dismissing | Close | Dismiss |
| Starting | Start | Generate report |
